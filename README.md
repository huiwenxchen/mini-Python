# Mini-Python


This repo contains short Python programs that I previously implemented in C: Mario, Cash, and Readability.

Mario prints pyramids made up of hashtags and spaces. Run this program by executing $ python mario.py <br/> 

Cash is a program that prompts users to enter the amount of change owed and then <br/>
determines the minimum number of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and/or pennies) needed to make the change.<br/>
To run Cash, execute $ python cash.py and wait for the prompt to input the change owed. Type in a number such as 0.21 and enter. <br/>
    Example usage:<br/>
    
      $ python cash.py
      Change owed: 0.21
      3
      
      $ python cash.py
      Change Owed: 1.77

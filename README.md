# Mini-Python


This repo contains short Python programs that I previously implemented in C: Mario, Cash, and Readability.

Mario prints a left-aligned pyramid made up of hashtags and spaces. Run this program by executing $ python mario.py and wait for the prompt toe enter the height of the desired pyramid. <br/> 
    Example usage:<br/>
    
        $ python mario.py
        Height: 5

Cash is a program that prompts users to enter the amount of change owed and then <br/>
determines the minimum number of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and/or pennies) needed to make the change.<br/>

To run Cash, execute $ python cash.py and wait for the prompt to input the change owed. Type in a number such as 0.21 and enter. <br/>
    Example usage:<br/>
    
        $ python cash.py
        Change owed: 0.21
        3

        $ python cash.py
        Change Owed: 1.77
        9

Readability computes the Coleman-Liau index of text input. To run the program, execute $ python readability.py and wait for the prompt to input text
    Example usage:<br/>

        $ python readability.py
        Text: How are you?
